        <h1>hi, i'm Caitlin.</h1>
        <p>I'm a backend software engineer looking for a new job where I can learn from my teammates and continue growing my experience working on designing systems and planning & implementing machine learning algorithms. I like the JVM (I know Java and Scala), but I'm excited to learn new languages too.</p>
        <p>My resume is below, but you can also download a pdf copy <a href="CaitlinJohnson-resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>
